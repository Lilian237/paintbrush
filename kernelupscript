Steps  for kernel upgrade/compile
1- Check the current kernel version

#uname –a  or uname –r to check your current version
2- copy the new kernel package to your system

Go to www.kernel.org to get the latest stable version (use wget to download it to your system)
3- extract the downloaded packakege.
Untar it 
#tar –xvf  <package>
3- Install depedencies

#cd into the package
#yum groupinstall “Development Tools”
#yum install openssl*
#yum install libncurses5-dev -y
#yum install ncurses-devel -y
4- choose all the options you need for your new kernel

#make menuconfig          

and make the changes on the kernel module and save it. It will generate the .config file which contain all the changes to the kernelt
If you don’t have any changes to make , you can do 
or #makedefconfig ( if you want the default features)

5- compile the kernel
#make 

 
6- will compile the module

#make    modules 

7- install the module driver     
#make   modules_install   

8-create the kernel image in the grub.conf file  , create the mapper to communicate with the hardware
#make install 

9- set the new kernel as default at boot   

go into the file 
/boot/grub/grub.conf  and make sure default =0 
This will automatically pick the new kernel at boot .

or if you want to choose it yourself, 
#reboot and choose the new kernel on the GRUB phase.
